# 🛡️ TryHackMe Write-Up: Beginner OPSEC

## 🔹 Room Overview
The **Beginner OPSEC** room introduces the fundamentals of *Operational Security (OPSEC)* — the process of identifying, analyzing, and protecting critical information from adversaries. Although commonly used in cybersecurity and the military, OPSEC principles apply to everyday workplaces, including retail, corporate, and personal life.

## 🔹 The Five Steps of OPSEC
OPSEC is a continuous cycle made up of **five principles**:

1. **Identify Critical Information**  
   Determine what information, if leaked, could harm operations.  
   *Example:* Employee schedules, login credentials, company policies.  

2. **Analyze Threats**  
   Understand who might want your information and why.  
   *Example:* Competitors, cybercriminals, insider threats.  

3. **Analyze Vulnerabilities**  
   Find weaknesses that could expose information.  
   *Example:* Metadata in photos, oversharing online, weak passwords.  

4. **Assess Risks**  
   Evaluate how likely a threat is to exploit a vulnerability and the potential impact.  
   *Example:* A leaked staff photo might reveal building access badges or work schedules.  

5. **Apply Countermeasures**  
   Put safeguards in place to reduce risk.  
   *Example:* Training staff on social media awareness, enforcing PoLP (Principle of Least Privilege), using MFA.

## 🔹 Key Lessons Learned
- 📸 **Photos can be a vulnerability** — a simple group photo might expose badge IDs, desk setups, or screens with sensitive data.  
- 🔑 **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** — seen in both cybersecurity and retail workplaces, PoLP ensures employees only access what they *need* for their job.  
- 🛒 **Retail analogy** — not all staff can access safe codes, manager logins, or system permissions, just like IT systems shouldn’t grant unnecessary admin rights.  
- 🌍 **OPSEC is universal** — whether in the military, corporate IT, or retail, the idea is the same: *small details can create big risks if overlooked*.

## 🔹 Personal Reflection
This room highlighted how **cybersecurity practices translate into everyday work**.  

In retail, I’ve seen PoLP firsthand — not everyone has access to every tool or system. That’s the same protection mindset that IT uses.  

The biggest takeaway: **OPSEC is everyone’s responsibility**. Even small details like what we post online or casually share with coworkers can become valuable intel for attackers.

## 🔹 Next Steps
- [ ] Apply OPSEC awareness when documenting labs and projects on GitHub.  
- [ ] Incorporate OPSEC into Red Team reconnaissance — look for oversharing, weak access controls, or leaked info.  
- [ ] Begin the **Splunk 101** room to gain Blue Team log analysis skills, balancing offense with defense.
